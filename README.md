# Humanoid Stair Climbing & Manipulation Research Archive

This repository is a curated archive of **research papers, methods, and resources** related to:

- Humanoid **stair climbing**
- **Locomotion + manipulation coupling**
- Motion **retargeting** to real humanoids
- **Reinforcement learning** for walking and balance
- **Physics-informed** and hybrid control
- **Vision-based affordances** for grasping and terrain understanding

The focus is on **mid-scale humanoids** such as **Unitree G1** and **Booster T1**, with an emphasis on **simulation-to-real transfer**.

##  Key Themes

-  Stair climbing with and without support rails  
-  Bimanual and tool-based manipulation during locomotion  
-  Human-to-humanoid motion retargeting  
-  Learning-based locomotion (RL, IL, AMP)  
-  Physics-aware control and constraints  
-  Vision and affordance reasoning for grasp & footholds
